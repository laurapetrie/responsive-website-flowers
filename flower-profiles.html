          <h3>Foxglove</h3>
          <p>
            Foxgloves are tall, stately plants native to Europe, western Asia
            and northwestern Africa. The flowers are tubular in shape, produced
            on a tall spike and vary in colour with species from purple to pink,
            white and yellow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best-known species is the common foxglove, Digitalis purpurea.
            This biennial is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vivid
            flowers and various marks and spottings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The generic epithet Digitalis is from the Latin digitus (finger).The
            name is recorded in Old English as 'foxes glofe/glofa' or 'fox's
            glove'. Over time, folk myths obscured the literal origins of the
            name, insinuating that foxes wore the flowers on their paws to
            silence their movements as they stealthily hunted their prey.
          </p>

          <h3>Hydrangea</h3>
          <p>
            Commonly named the hortensia, hydrangea is a genus of over 75
            species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. By far
            the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China,
            Korea, and Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name is derived from Greek and means 'water vessel' due to the
            shape of its seed capsules. The flowers of hydrangea act as natural
            pH indicators, sporting blue flowers when the soil is acidic and
            pink when the soil is alkaline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hydrangeas are popular ornamental plants, grown for their large
            flowerheads, with Hydrangea macrophylla (meaning bigleaf hydrangea)
            being by far the most widely grown. It has over 600 named cultivars
            and can be broken up into two main categories; mophead and lacecap.
          </p>

          <h3>Lisianthus</h3>
          <p>
            Eustoma, commonly known in English as lisianthus or prairie gentian,
            is a small genus of plants in the gentian family. They are native to
            warm regions of the southern US, Mexico, Caribbean and northern
            South America. They are typically found in grasslands and in areas
            of disturbed ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are herbaceous annuals, with bluish green, slightly succulent
            leaves and large funnel-shaped flowers growing on long straight
            stems. The flowers are either single or double-flowered and found in
            a wide variety of colours: pink, peach, purple, blue, white, brown
            and red.
          </p>
          <p>
            The genus name Eustoma is a compound of the Greek prefix eu- 'good /
            pleasing' and -stoma , 'mouth' - hence '( having a ) pleasing
            mouth'.

          <h3>Peony</h3>
          <p>
            The peony or paeony is a flowering plant in the genus Paeonia and
            are native to Asia, Europe and Western North America. They have
            large, often fragrant flowers, in colors ranging from purple and
            pink to red, white, peach or yellow.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are popular garden plants and are also sold as cut flowers on a
            large scale. They have a small window of availability from late
            spring to early summer, which accounts for their high demand for
            wedding flowers at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The peony is named after Paeon, a student of Asclepius, the Greek
            god of medicine and healing. In Greek mythology, when Asclepius
            became jealous of his pupil, Zeus saved Paeon from the wrath of
            Asclepius by turning him into the peony flower.

            Europe, and northeastern Africa.

          <p>
            Double-flowered forms are a popular ornamental plant in gardens, and
            widely used in floristry. The italian cultivated Cloni ranunculus
            has many petals resembling a mini peony. They come in a variety of
            colours from white, green, pink, yellow, red, orange and peach with
            some having multicolored, ruffled petals.
          </p>

          <h3>Rose</h3>
          <p>
            The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that have been bred for
            their flowers and perfume. They have been cultivated for millennia,
            with the earliest known to date from at least 500 BC in
            Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China.
          </p>
          <p>
            The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often
            as a symbol in mythology and art. It has closely been associated
            with Aphrodite in ancient Greece and the Virgin Mary following the
            Christianization of the Roamn Empire. Roses are a favored subject in
            art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments
            or as architectural elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The David Austen Juliet Rose is one of the most expensive roses in
            the world. They are distinguished by their full cups, peachy scent
            and beautiful apricot colored petals.
